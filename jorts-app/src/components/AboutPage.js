      <p>
        Welcome to JORTS! 
      </p>
      <p>
      JORTS, which stands for "Join Others, Rate Today's Styles" is a unique social media platform combining the fun of sharing your daily outfits with the interactive twist of “Would You Rather.” 
      </p>
      <p>
      Users are prompted to upload a daily outfit photo ("fit pic") and then participate in a game-like environment where they vote on other users' outfits.
      </p>
      <p>
      The platform enables users to share details about their clothing when posting their outfits, add reactions, and receive feedback from others, fostering a fashion-focused community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vote for your favorite outfits and leave comments to share your thoughts with the community.
        Engage with the fashion community, share your looks, and find inspiration.
        We aim to make fashion fun, engaging, and interactive for everyone.
