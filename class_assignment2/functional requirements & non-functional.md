JORTS, which stands for "Join Others, Rate Today's Styles," is an online fashion app with social aspects where users can post daily photos of their outfits and also play an interactive game with the app’s community. Taking inspiration from the popular game "Would You Rather" and the mobile app “BeReal”, users vote on and compare the outfits of 2 users who posted on that day, with the option to add comments, feedback, and styling tips.


## 5 functional requirements:

1. Users should be able to upload a png. or jpg. file from their computer or mobile device (mobile functionality permitting).
a. Stretch goal: Have users be required to take a picture before being given access to view other posts
b. Stretch goal: Allow mobile users to take a photo and have the photo uploaded into the app instantly (without searching for existing png./jpeg.)

2. Users should be able to add a caption and general description of the outfit or individual articles of clothing highlighting details like: store of purchase, price, manufacturer, size, fit style.

3. Users should be able to comment publicly under another user's post and have that comment remain on the post until the commenter or poster removes it.

4. Users should be able to tag their posts and their post will then be added to that tag category which can be viewed to see all posts under that tag. If a tag written by a user does not currently exist then the tag will be created and their post will become the first post on the tag.

5. Users should be able to make their posts public or private to only be viewed by other whitelisted users. The publicity of posts should be able to be modified after post creation.

6. Users have to post their own OOTD (outfit of the day) before being able to interact with other users' posts.



## 5 non-functional requirements:

1. The app’s scalability has to be able to support a certain amount of users at the same time(depending on the size of users on the platform) without performance degradation regardless of platform size.

2. All pages and features within the app should load within 5 seconds under normal operating conditions to maintain a quick and responsive experience for users.

3. The platform has to comply with all accessibility standards (for example WCAG 2.1 AA) to make sure there is inclusivity for all users, including users with disabilities. The app must also have portability in which it must be supported on many platforms such as iOS, Android, web browsers,etc., with equal functionality.

4. All user data, including posts, personal information, etc., must be properly encrypted and protected using industry standard methods such as AES-256. User specific privacy settings must also be respected and properly upheld according to the users’ preferences so that users have full control over who is able to view their content.

5. The platform must be reliable under all circumstances and should maintain 99.9% uptime to make sure there is uninterrupted access and minimal downtime for users.
