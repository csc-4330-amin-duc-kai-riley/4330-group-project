Project Title:
JORTS: Join Others, Rate Today's Styles

Description:
JORTS is a unique social media platform combining the fun of sharing your daily outfits with the interactive twist of “Would You Rather.” Users are prompted to upload a daily outfit photo ("fit pic") and then participate in a game-like environment where they vote on other users' outfits. The platform enables users to share details about their clothing when posting their outfits, add reactions, and receive feedback from others, fostering a fashion-focused community.

We will be moving towards a different website template in the future as we are trying to achieve a more modern and sleek look for the website user interface.

The JORTS About Page provides a description of our application to users and suggestions how users should utilize the platform to better engage with the fashion community.

Upload Outfit Page:

The Upload Outfit Page allows users to share their daily outfit with the JORTS community. The page features an upload button labeled "Choose File," which lets users select an image file from their device. Once uploaded, the outfit is saved to the user's profile and becomes eligible for the voting poll. Users can upload 1 outfit picture a day, and the timer resets at 12 AM everyday.















Outfit Voting Page:












Description:

The JORTS home page’s main feature is a live feed of the current poll which allows users to vote for their preferred outfits as they appear on screen. In its current state, the page only displays our placeholder boxes in the place of outfits, but through further additions users will be able to upload their outfits to be saved to their account and featured in the voting poll.

This interface’s centerpiece is the voting poll where one user’s outfit is displayed on the left side of the screen, while another user’s outfit is displayed on the right. Beneath their images, spectators can vote for which outfit they favor and use the comment field below the polling boxes to provide additional live feedback that will be appended to the chat log at the bottom of the page labeled “Comments”.
