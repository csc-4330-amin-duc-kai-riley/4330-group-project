JORTS, which stands for "Join Others, Rate Today's Styles," is an online fashion app with social aspects where users can post daily photos of their outfits and also participate in an interactive game with the app’s community. Taking inspiration from the popular game "Would You Rather" and the mobile app “BeReal”, users vote on and compare each other's outfits, with the ability to add comments, reactions, and styling tips. Users can also add information about the products used in their outfits, including brand names, price tags, item names, and places of purchase. JORTS provides a fun and interactive community that is perfect for anyone interested in fashion or wishing to get started.


## Personas, Scenarios, and User Stories


## At least two personas in your software application

### Persona 1:
---------------------
Robert, age 22, is a fashion design student in LA and works with his peers to explore new ideas and seed new trends in his area. Growing up he was enamored with the high fashion trends that would permeate through the 00s and 10s and grew invested in where these trends are heading into the coming decades and where he can leave his mark on the industry. In his formative years he grew accustomed with applications like Snapchat and Instagram where he often would make collections of selfies featuring his most vibrant and artistic outfits. 

Robert has broad interests in fashion scenes both domestic and foreign, but sharing findings with his peers is vital to his success. He believes that an app centered around exclusively sharing fashion tastes and outfits would be quite useful to find inspiration now that he's working to become a professional fashion designer.


### Persona 2:
---------------------
Ellie, age 30, is an office worker who takes a lot of pride her presentation at work and in public. In college she was a local icon for her wardrobe and she sees fashion as a key form of her own self expression. She is always on the lookout online for new clothing that is unique, practical, and affordable. She feels comfortable purchasing clothing when she has as many accurate details on a particular article of clothing as possible, preferably with several opinions from previous buyers.

Ellie thinks that an app which allows her to discover new clothing while having instant access to detailed information on each article of an outfit would streamline her process of creating new outfits to express herself. Being able to share the details of her own threads would make it easier to answer the question she often gets from friends and coworkers: "Where did you get that top?".


## At least two scenarios in which your users will be interacting with your software application

### Scenario 1:
---------------------
Jay the Fashion Icon  
Jay is a college student and rising social media influencer because of his interest in fashion. He frequently uploads pictures of his outfits on Instagram, and although he tags the brands from where he gets his clothes (if they have an account), people still wonder if the item is available for purchase, where to find it on the site, and if they can find it in person. 

Additionally, a lot of Jay’s friends ask him for advice on their outfits and recommendations on where to get their clothes. Doing this through current existing social media begins to get messy, as his messages are filled with spam, compliments, and advice requests from his friends. 

Jay’s friend, a software engineer, introduces him to a new website he created called, “[insert project name].” In getting to use the website, he sets up an account, and uploads his first, daily, picture. He puts detailed information about all of his clothing items, including price, brand, and where he found it. After setting up his account, he heads to the main page to compare today’s outfits to each other for a while, adding comments and reactions to each. Afterwards, he checks the leaderboard of the people who were voted for most, and gets additional styling inspiration from their photos. After completing all of these steps, Jay looks at the achievements he’s accumulated on his profile page and is motivated to keep using the website.


### Scenario 2:
---------------------
Amy, a fashion influencer, is overwhelmed by questions from her followers about where to buy her outfits and how she styles them. A fashion startup approaches her with an idea for a new platform, “[insert project name]”, where users can upload daily outfit photos and engage in a “Would You Rather” style voting game. The platform also allows influencers like Amy to provide details about where they bought their clothes, give styling tips, and interact with followers through comments and reactions. Excited by the idea, Amy agrees to collaborate, seeing it as the perfect solution for sharing her outfits and engaging with her audience in an organized way.

After gathering Amy’s requirements, they design and implement a user-friendly platform with voting features, shopping links, and social interactions. Through testing and feedback from Amy and other influencers, the platform is refined and eventually launched. Amy can now easily upload her daily outfits, respond to her fans, and participate in fun engagement features like leaderboards and achievements.
